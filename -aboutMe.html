									<h1>Paul Brown</h1>
									<p>Mathematical engineering student.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Mathematical engineer finishing my masters at the University of Bristol looking for employment within the sector. I have designed, developed and manufactured prototypes and have experience leading and working within demanding, time constrained analytical group projects. Successful accademic track record with award winning projects. I am ready to enter the industrial world and continue this route.</p>
								<p>Born and raised in Spain I moved to England during my high school years in search of different experiences and alternative education. I had always had a keed eye for detail and when I was young you could always find me taking apart a device and hoping I could get it to work again, this did not earn me any brownie points with my mother. I held onto this passion for figuring out how the world worked, focusing on physics and mathematics for my studies, but it was not until I had finished my A-levels and began a course in Mechanical Engineering that I rediscovered my love for piecing it all together. Have made a couple mistakes along the way, however, I have always seen these as a way to learn and improve and not simply as a failure. When I am not busy with a project I will be jamming on my guitar, learning a new skill or finding a new hobby. </p>
