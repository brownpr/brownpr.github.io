								<p>Statement of Purpose </p>
								<p>Mathematical engineer in the process of completing a masterâ€™s programme at the
									University of Bristol and looking for employment within the sector. I have designed,
									developed and manufactured prototypes and have experience leading and working
									within demanding, time constrained analytical group projects. Successful academic
									track record with award winning projects. I am ready to enter the industrial world and
									continue this route.</p>

								<p>Personal description</p>
								<p> Born and raised in southern Spain, my family and I moved to the UK in search for better opportunities and for higher education. I always have had a keen eye for detail, and an over-abundance of creativity and curiosity since a young age. You could always find me de- and re-constructing anything I could get my hands on, often crossing my fingers hoping it would work when put back to better (much to the dismay of my mother). This passion and wonder for the world continues to persist in me well into my high school education in England, where I dedicated myself to physics and mathematics. My A-levels were a challenge since they focused on as they did not focus on creating but rather on regurgitating information. Ultimately, it was not until I began a course in Mechanical Engineering that I rekindled my love and wonder for the field. To this day I cannot buy a toy without taking it apart within the first few days and spend my spare time on new projects; learning new skills; jamming on the guitar or learning a new hobby. My favourite hobbies include: carpentry, where I have built my own guitar; computer software and hardware, often taking my pc apart after construction and learning a new language (currently solidity). The hardships and detours I have faced pursuing my career have only served in my favour to better understand my passions and make me a more well-rounded engineer with knowledge within many facets of this diverse and wonderful field. </p>
