								<!-- IMAGE OF ME-->
								<!-- <div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div> -->
								<p>Junior software engineer with experience within industrial environments creating state of the art solutions.
									With experience leading and working within demanding, time constrained analytical group projects both within 
									industrial and personal projects. Successful academic track record with award winning projects. Passionate about
									 Artificial intelligence and Data-Analysis looking to develop these skill within a multicultural environment.
								</p>

								<p> As I was born and raised in southern Spain, Spanish has become my second native language. In 2009, my family and I
									 moved to the UK to complete my education. This experience gave me a passion for learning new cultures and I will 
									 seek out and jump onto any opportunity that allows me to travel. After I finished the modules for my MSc in Engineering Mathematics, 
									 I decided to return to Spain, where I got an internship with an integrated masters at Airbus Defence and Space. This has 
									 given me a thirst for industrial roles and projects; where one can see their hard work bare fruit.
								 </p>

								 <p>
									Passionate about creating and developing. If you don't find me at the computer I'll either be strumming away at the guitar or
									 crafting something. Dreaming of setting up a workshop in my garage and getting my hands dirty with some carpentry.
